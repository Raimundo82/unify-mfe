The game uses virtual editions of the LdoD Archive, so\n            registration is necessary to play and create games. The objective is to classify fragments of\n            virtual editions through several games.

The user votes on a category, but can\n                        change their vote while the time is available (changes in vote penalize their\n                        points) and simultaneously sees the total votes, i.e., in real time, checking which\n                        category is most voted, seeing the votes in the categories vary as the participants\n                        vote.
