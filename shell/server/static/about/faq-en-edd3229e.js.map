   What is the <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        The <em>LdoD Archive</em> is a collaborative digital archive of the{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em> by Fernando Pessoa. It contains images of the\n        autograph documents, new transcriptions of those documents and also\n        transcriptions of four editions of the work. In addition to reading and\n        comparing transcriptions, the <em>LdoD Archive</em> enables users to\n        collaborate in creating virtual editions of the{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em>. It also includes a writing module which, in\n        the future, will allow users to write variations based on fragments from\n        the <em>Book</em>. Thus the <em>LdoD Archive</em>\n        combines a representational principle with a simulation principle: the\n        first is expressed through the representation of the history and\n        processes of writing and editing the <em>Book</em>; the second is\n        embodied in the fact that users are given the possibility of playing\n        various roles in the literary process (reading, editing, writing), using\n        the flexibility of the digital medium for experimenting with the{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em> as a literary machine.\n      </p>\n\n      <h5 id=\"Q02Q\">\n        What does the <em>LdoD Archive</em> contain?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        The <em>LdoD Archive</em> consists of a group of fragments that Fernando\n        Pessoa explicitly attributed to the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>\n        and another group, without the indication \"L. do D.\", which its editors\n        have chosen based on material or stylistic evidence from the autograph\n        witnesses. For each fragment the <em>Archive</em> contains the set of\n        interpretations associated with it. An interpretation is constituted by\n        a transcription of the text and a set of metadata about it, such as date\n        or heteronym attribution, or the indication of the shelf-mark of the\n        National Library of Portugal that identifies the witness. The various\n        editors of the <em>Book</em> have produced interpretations that may\n        differ in both transcription and metadata. Thus, in the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em>, a fragment has interpretations by its editors\n        (editorial interpretations), and it may occur that some of the editors\n        do not consider a given fragment as part of the{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, in which case there will be no interpretation\n        associated with that expert. In addition, a fragment has one or more\n        interpretations of the witnesses (authorial interpretations), and there\n        may be several authorial interpretations of the same fragment due, for\n        example, to the existence of several manuscripts or typescripts for the\n        same text. The transcription and metadata associated with an authorial\n        interpretation is the responsibility of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> team.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q03Q\">\n        What is a fragment in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n\n      <p>\n        A fragment is a modular textual sequence and it constitutes the basic\n        unit of composition of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>. Most textual sequences\n        are also separated material units, since they are written in single\n        loose sheets (or small groups of loose sheets) without a defined\n        relative ordering. The fragments encoded in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>\n        correspond to the sum of all texts that were considered as belonging to\n        or associated with the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> by the four critical\n        editions, including those texts that are published as appendix or annex\n        to the main text.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q04Q\">\n        What is the relationship between a text in the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>{' '}\n        and a fragment in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        All fragments of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> are also textual units of the\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em> according to at least one of the editions. The\n        structure of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> places all the fragments at the\n        same relative distance from one another, that is, with the same\n        modularity index. However, in the editions, not all textual units have\n        the same degree of relative independence, since there are groups of\n        texts that are closer to each other, either because they are part of a\n        larger textual unit, or because of thematic or chronological proximity.\n        The textual units of the editions have different indexes of modularity,\n        as there are groups of texts which are closer to one another. This is\n        the main difference between a text as a unit within a given edition and\n        a fragment as a unit within the <em>LdoD Archive</em>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h5 id=\"Q05Q\">\n        Why is the fragment treated as a modular unit in the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n\n      <p>\n        The modular organization of the fragments (i.e., the fact that they at\n        the same relative distance from each other) in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>\n        is a precondition for the comparison and virtualization of the editions\n        to be processed in the open way envisioned by our model. This stressing\n        of the modular fragmentarity of the <em>Book</em> in the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em> is a critical tool for opening up this work's\n        potential for reading, editing and writing to new interventions. The\n        distortion introduced by our data model — which is the major support of\n        the dynamic features of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>— gives technical\n        expression to a digital rematerialization of documents, texts and work\n        beyond bibliographic models. The <em>Book of Disquiet</em> is not an\n        entirely free assemblage of loose fragments, but the radial and\n        hetararchical configuration of its units in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>\n        allows us to simulate authorial projectuality and editorial\n        projectuality as processes for imagining the work as a book.\n      </p>\n\n      <h5 id=\"Q06Q\">\n        What is an interpretation in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        An interpretation is the set formed by a transcription and the metadata\n        associated with it. The interpretations of the five versions (i.e., the\n        four editions by the experts and our genetic representation of the\n        witnesses) are not totally coincident with each other, either because of\n        micro-textual variations and differences (orthography, punctuation,\n        choice of variants, internal ordering of paragraphs, for example), or by\n        macro-textual variations (i.e., relative division of fragments, ordering\n        of the fragment within the architecture of the <em>Book</em>, inclusion\n        or exclusion of a given fragment from the corpus of the <em>Book</em>).\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q07Q\">\n        Why do fragments have more than one editorial interpretation for the\n        same editor?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        This is because editors sometimes split a fragment or associate multiple\n        fragments. For example, an editor may consider a given fragment as being\n        a single text and another editor may consider it to be two distinct\n        texts, which means that for the first editor the Archive associates a\n        single interpretation to that fragment while for the second editor it\n        associates two interpretations.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q08Q\">\n        What is the authorial interpretation representative of a fragment?\n      </h5>\n\n      <p>\n        It is the authorial interpretation of a printed source, if it exists; if\n        a printed source does not exist, it is the interpretation of a\n        typescript source; and if a typescript source does not exist, it is the\n        interpretation of a manuscript source. It is necessary to define a\n        representative authorial interpretation in order to have a reference\n        transcription, for example, for calculating the textual similarity\n        between two fragments when using the recommendation algorithm.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 id=\"T2T\">Witnesses</h3>\n      <h5 id=\"Q09Q\">What are the witnesses?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The witnesses are the interpretations of the fragments made up of\n        genetic transcriptions of handwritten and typewritten autographs, and\n        also of printed texts published by Pessoa, all of which have been\n        encoded by the <em>LdoD Archive</em> team. In addition to the\n        transcription, there is a set of metadata about the documentary\n        witnesses (material and medium of the inscription, paper size, other\n        document features, BNP shelf-mark, etc.).\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q10Q\">What is a genetic transcription?</h5>\n\n      <p>\n        It is a transcription that allows you to observe the authorial writing\n        and revision process, recording all layers of textual composition and\n        not just the final version. Deletions, additions, substitutions, and\n        transpositions made during and after the initial stage of writing have\n        been marked up.\n      </p>\n\n      <h5 id=\"Q11Q\">\n        What can we see in the interface for visualizing authorial sources?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        This interface allows you to see the transcription of an authorial\n        witness that respects the topography of line breaks and the distribution\n        of spaces of the original. It also allows you to see the textual\n        elements canceled, substituted, added or transposed by Fernando Pessoa,\n        as well as the digital facsimile of the original documents. All textual\n        variants are also represented, that is, those textual passages for which\n        there are two or more alternatives.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q12Q\">What is the facsimile?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The facsimile is a digital image of the original document, which is\n        represented by the page unit (with the exception of published sources,\n        in which the double spread is used). The <em>LdoD Archive</em> includes\n        images of all written documents whose text has been assigned or related\n        to the <em>Book</em>. There are therefore sheets represented by{' '}\n        <em>recto</em>\n        pages only, and others by <em>recto </em>and <em>verso </em>pages.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q13Q\">\n        What is the difference between witnesses and encoded fragments?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        The designations “witnesses” and “encoded fragments” are different\n        perspectives on the same materials. “Witnesses” presents a perspective\n        of the materials based on the units defined by the National Library of\n        Portugal (BNP), i.e., based on the shelf-marks that determine the\n        material unit of each autograph document as a referable object. “Encoded\n        fragments”, in turn, presents a perspective of the materials based on\n        the units of the\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em> itself, that is, of the XML files as units that\n        guarantee the modularity of the fragments and the interpretations\n        (transcriptions) associated with them. If their respective tables are\n        observed, their rationale becomes clearer: the 754 witnesses correspond\n        to all BNP autograph documents that have a specific shelf-mark (or, in\n        the case of some letters by Fernando Pessoa, shelf-marks from other\n        archives) and also to twelve published texts; the 720 “encoded\n        fragments” correspond to the XML files of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>,\n        each of which contains a number of interpretations for the same\n        fragment. From the point of view of our data model in the Archive, it is\n        as if the fragment were an abstract entity, which then has multiple\n        instantiations: the transcriptions by JPC, TSC, RZ and JP, and also our\n        own transcriptions of the witnesses. Usually there is only one\n        interpretation of each edition for each fragment (that is, five in all),\n        but this number can go up to seven when, in addition to the five\n        editorial interpretations there are several autographs — for example,\n        two different typewritten witnesses and a version published in a\n        magazine. In this case, the <em>LdoD Archive</em>\n        transcribes the three autograph versions. The table of “encoded\n        fragments” offers an overall picture of the contents of the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em>. From a theoretical point of view, we can say that\n        the XML files are documents of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> just as the\n        autographs are documents of Fernando Pessoa’s archive in the BNP. The\n        latter are represented in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> through a facsimile\n        image and a new topographic genetic transcription.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 id=\"T3T\">Experts’ Editions</h3>\n      <h5 id=\"Q14Q\">What are the experts’ editions?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The editions by the experts included in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> are\n        the main critical editions published between 1982 and 2012. These four\n        critical editions (prepared from the autographs) were organized,\n        respectively, by Jacinto do Prado Coelho (1982; reprinted 1997), Teresa\n        Sobral Cunha (2008; 1st ed. 1990-1991), Richard Zenith (2012; 1st ed.\n        1998), and Jerónimo Pizarro (2010). The sequence of presentation of the\n        experts' editions in the menu corresponds to the chronological order of\n        the date of their original publication. The editions by the experts are\n        therefore very significant both from a philological point of view, and\n        from the point of view of the socialization of the work. Although the\n        relative scale of each critical apparatus varies considerably, those\n        four editors have worked from the originals with the aim of producing a\n        readable integral version of the <em>Book</em>. In addition, these\n        editions have determined the dissemination of the{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em> since 1982, both in Portuguese and in other\n        languages, since they were taken as a basis for other Portuguese\n        editions and for numerous translations. With the exception of Jacinto do\n        Prado Coelho's edition, which was reprinted only once without changes\n        after its editor's death, all other editions have been altered and\n        corrected whenever there is a new publication. The Jacinto do Prado\n        Coelho (1920-1984)’s edition is historically significant because it was\n        the first, and the other three are historically significant because they\n        demonstrate the possibility of reediting and reorganizing the{' '}\n        <em>Book.</em>\n        Jerónimo Pizarro's edition is also significant for having ordered the\n        texts by date of composition and for having developed a systematic and\n        exhaustive critical-genetic apparatus.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q15Q\">Why were these specific experts’ editions selected?</h5>\n      <p>\n        Because these four editions (Coelho 1982; Sobral Cunha 2008; Zenith\n        2012; and Pizarro 2010) were the latest editions when we began encoding\n        the files for the <em>LdoD Archive</em> in the year 2012. The 1982\n        edition (reprinted only once in 1997) is the only one that has not\n        changed. The other three editions have continued to undergo a number\n        small of changes (in the corpus, in the transcription, in the ordering\n        of texts), although they have maintained their basic structure and\n        principles of organization. In the meantime (i.e., since 2012) new\n        editions have already been published (Sobral Cunha 2013; Pizarro 2013\n        and 2014; Zenith 2015).\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q16Q\">Will the experts' editions be updated in the future?</h5>\n\n      <p>\n        While the experts have expressed their desire to see the latest version\n        of their editions represented in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>, a future\n        update will depend on resources available to re-encode the files so that\n        they can reflect changes made in a particular new edition. In order to\n        guarantee the philological rigor of our scholarly work, it is necessary\n        that the interpretations contained in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> for\n        representing the experts’ editions correspond to a specific witness (in\n        this case, the editions Coelho-1982, Sobral Cunha-2008, Zenith-2012 and\n        Pizarro-2010), and not to an eclectic combination of readings collected\n        in different editions of the text.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q17Q\">\n        Why did you not include the new edition by Teresa Rita Lopes (2015)?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        In 2015 Teresa Rita Lopes published a new edition titled{' '}\n        <em>Book(s) of Disquiet</em>, in which she adds thirty-five texts by\n        Barão de Teive to the corpus of texts attributed to Vicente Guedes and\n        Bernardo Soares. Although the edition by Teresa Rita Lopes is a new\n        demonstration of the projectual nature of the authorial and editorial\n        forms of the work — reinforcing, to a certain extent, the theoretical\n        justification of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> for developing its dynamic\n        functionalities — it was not possible to include it because all the\n        encoding had been completed and we did not have the additional resources\n        needed to re-encode the files. Otherwise, her edition would have been\n        included since it meets the conditions by which we have defined the\n        expert editions.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"T4T\">XML-TEI encoding</h3>\n      <h5 id=\"Q18Q\">\n        How did we encode the texts in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        The encoding was made according to the guidelines of the Text Encoding\n        Initiative (TEI) in the P5 version of the implementation. An example of\n        our XML encoding template can be found{' '}\n        <strong>\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/encoding/LdoD_XML-Template_EN.xml\">\n            HERE\n          </a>\n        </strong>\n        . The work was carried out over four years, by a team of five people,\n        representing a total of twelve thousand hours of encoding and revision.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q19Q\">What elements have been encoded?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The XML encoding of both the witnesses and the four expert editions\n        contained in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> has been extremely granular, so\n        that all variations could become comparable either (a) at the internal\n        microtextual scale of each fragment, or (b ) at the macrotextual scale\n        of the external organization of the fragments in the <em>Book</em>, or\n        (c) at the level of the metadata about each item in the Archive. The\n        elements that have been formally represented include (a) punctuation,\n        spelling, words, division/aggregation of paragraphs and spaces between\n        paragraphs, but also (b) division/aggregation and ordering of fragments\n        within the structure of the <em>Book</em>, as well as (c)\n        metainformation concerning editorial attribution of date and heteronym\n        or relative to the material nature of the witnesses. In the case of the\n        witnesses, all acts of authorial revision (deletions, additions,\n        substitutions, variants) have been encoded, as well as the topography of\n        line breaks and the use of spaces or rules for dividing blocks of text\n        in all documents. In the case of the experts editions all spaces and\n        rules of division between paragraphs have also been marked up.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"T5T\">Edition Comparison</h3>\n      <h5 id=\"Q20Q\">What is the edition comparison interface for?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The edition comparison interface has been designed to relate the various\n        interpretations of the same fragment (i.e., interpretations of the\n        witnesses and interpretations of experts’ editions) to each other. The\n        parallel segmentation and visualization of the fragments allows you to\n        compare the transcriptions of each fragment, as well as their relative\n        position within the order of the <em>Book.</em>\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q21Q\">What does the “highlight differences” view show?</h5>\n      <p>\n        This feature shows the points of variation between the interpretations\n        being compared. These variation points are highlighted in blue within\n        the body of the text, and they are also presented in the form of a table\n        following the text at the bottom of the page. The variations in the\n        shades of blue highlight the relative amount of variation: the existence\n        of variation in a single interpretation results in the lighter blue\n        shade and the existence of variations in all interpretations results in\n        the darker blue shade, and there are also two intermediate shades.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q22Q\">Which are the differentiation units for highlighting?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The differentiation units for highlighting can be of four types: (a)\n        word or group of words, (b) punctuation mark, (c) sentence or group of\n        sentences, and (d) part of a fragment or an entire fragment. The{' '}\n        <em>word or group of words</em> highlight indicates orthographic\n        variations or substantive variations in the compared transcriptions. For\n        example, the Prado Coelho-1982 and Pizarro-2010 editions follow the\n        spelling of the original document while the Cunha-2008 and Zenith-2012\n        editions modernize the spelling according to the orthographic standard\n        at the time of publication. These cases are indicated in the table of\n        variations by the typology \"orthographic\" (that is, orthographic\n        variation), while substantive variations in transcription (for example,\n        when the experts choose different variants or read a particular passage\n        differently) are marked in the table of variations by the typology\n        \"substantive\" (that is, substantive variation). The{' '}\n        <em>punctuation mark</em> highlight indicates that the compared\n        transcriptions do not punctuate a particular passage in the same way.\n        These cases are marked in the table of variations by the typology\n        \"punctuation\" (that is, variation of punctuation). Highlighting{' '}\n        <em>a sentence or a group of</em> <em>sentences</em> indicates that one\n        or more transcriptions divide paragraphs differently. These cases are\n        indicated in the table of variations by the typology \"paragraph\" (that\n        is, variation in the division of paragraphs). Highlighting{' '}\n        <em>a part of</em> or <em>the entire fragment</em> indicates that the\n        compared editions have split the fragments differently, that is, the\n        match is not one text to one text, but one to two or to more than two\n        texts. In these cases, the table of variations indicates both those\n        macro-textual differences and the points of variation at the lower scale\n        of the word or group of words, punctuation mark, and sentence or group\n        of sentences.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q60Q\">\n        Why does highlighting sometimes repeat single words that belong to a\n        highlighted textual block?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        {' '}\n        When paragraphs are divided differently from each other in the corpus of\n        the five transcriptions, we have encoded two overlapping types of\n        difference: a) differences at word level and b) differences at the level\n        of the paragraph as a whole. The program interprets those differences\n        twice: it highlights the individual words that are marked as different\n        within the paragraph (repeating them at the beginning or at the end of\n        the textual block), while also highlighting the marked up difference of\n        the paragraph as a whole. This happens because the parallel segmentation\n        method we have adopted in the encoding does not allow overlapping\n        hierarchies. The representation of the two types of difference —\n        differences in paragraph division and differences between words within\n        those paragraphs — must be made by duplicating the encoding hierarchy,\n        which results in highlighting words and paragraphs in this way.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q23Q\">What does the comparison reveal about the editions?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The comparison provides a better understanding of each edition and makes\n        explicit editorial criteria that are not always stated in the general\n        editorial principles, both for individual transcriptions and for the\n        overall ordering of fragments. For instance, the automatic comparison\n        enables you to see several options and editorial interventions in terms\n        of reading passages that are difficult to decipher, choosing variants,\n        punctuating texts, dividing/aggregating paragraphs, and\n        dividing/aggregating fragments. The comparison (not only of these four\n        editions against each other, but also when we exmine the history of each\n        expert’s edition) reveals that, over time, the readings of\n        difficult-to-read passages (and for which conjectural readings were\n        originally offered) shows less variation across the editions, since\n        newly deciphered passages, with a greater probability of being correct,\n        are incorporated in subsequent editions, demonstrating that the experts\n        cooperate in the effort to read the Pessoa’s handwriting, which is often\n        idiosyncratic and variable. Although at the granular scale of\n        deciphering characters and words there is less variation among editions\n        over time, the comparison further reveals that the editors who continued\n        to re-edit the text (Sobral Cunha, Zenith, and Pizarro) are consistent\n        in the original macro-organization of fragments in their respective\n        editions, which remain faithful to the structure and model that they\n        initially conceived. With the exception of minor changes, the ordering\n        of the fragments in the <em>Book </em>has remained stable from edition\n        to edition. The most significant changes can be found in editions by\n        Teresa Sobral Cunha, in particular the inclusion or exclusion of a\n        significant number of texts from one edition to another.At the scale of\n        the <em>Book</em>, comparisons across the experts’ editions corpus allow\n        us to prove the existence of four distinct models for producing the{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet.</em>\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q24Q\">\n        Is it possible to compare an editorial or authorial interpretation with\n        a virtual interpretation?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        No, because a virtual interpretation never changes the transcription of\n        the interpretation it uses.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q25Q\">\n        What does the comparison of fragments’ annotations in virtual editions\n        show?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        In this interface it is possible to compare the annotations that the\n        virtual editors applied on the virtual interpretations. For example,\n        what was cited, and what notes and tags were associated with the\n        citation by the virtual editors. Note that the comparison is between\n        interpretations of the same fragment even when the base interpretation\n        used is not the same.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"T6T\">Search</h3>\n      <p>\n        The search allows you to select fragments according to a set of\n        criteria.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q26Q\">What is simple search?</h5>\n      <p>\n        In simple search it is possible to select the set of fragments according\n        to two criteria: text and type of source. The text criterion can be\n        applied to the entire textual transcription or only to its title. The\n        result is the set of interpretations that include the textual string\n        entered in the search field. It should be noted that the search result\n        may include several interpretations associated with the same fragment\n        (i.e., authorial interpretations and editorial interpretations).\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q27Q\">\n        Which characters are allowed in the search criteria by text?\n      </h5>\n\n      <p>\n        Only alpha-numeric characters, hyphen, ampersand and space are allowed.\n        All other characters are ignored, for example, when entering \"al*ma\" in\n        the search field the result will include all interpretations where the\n        word \"alma\" appears. Note that there is no distinction between lowercase\n        and uppercase, so in the previous example the result will also include\n        those interpretations where the word \"Alma\" appears.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q28Q\">What is advanced search?</h5>\n      <p>\n        In advanced search you can use a larger set of criteria. In addition, it\n        is possible to perform a search by combining the criteria in two ways:\n        according to <em>all of the criteria</em> or according to{' '}\n        <em>only one of the criteria</em>. If it meets all the criteria, the\n        result will contain the fragments that for each of the defined criteria\n        have at least one interpretation that satisfies one criterion. For\n        example, in a search where \"alma liberdade\" is introduced in the text\n        field, and \"Vicente Guedes\" is chosen in the heteronym field, the result\n        will include all the fragments that have at least one interpretation\n        that use both words in their text and that have at least one\n        interpretation that attributes the fragment to Vicente Guedes. Note that\n        it does not need to be the same interpretation to satisfy both criteria,\n        it is only required that they are interpretations of the same fragment.\n        In case the search is according to at least one of the criteria, the\n        result will contain all the fragments that have an interpretation that\n        satisfies at least one of the criteria. Using the previous example, the\n        result will include fragments that have at least one interpretation\n        attributed to Vicente Guedes or that have the words \"alma\" and\n        \"liberdade.\" In both cases, the search result includes the\n        interpretations of the selected fragments, indicating which criteria\n        each interpretation satisfies, and thus justifying the reason why the\n        fragment was selected.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"T7T\">Reading</h3>\n      <p>\n        The reading interface offers the possibility of reading the fragments of\n        the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> according to the sequences proposed by\n        each of its editors. In addition, the <em>Archive </em>recommends a\n        reading sequence based on weights (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, with\n        intervals of 0.2) that the user can assign to four criteria: heteronym,\n        date, text, and taxonomy. For the fragment that the user is currently\n        reading the system recommends what it considers closest according to a\n        measure of distance between fragments.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q29Q\">How is the distance between two fragments calculated?</h5>\n      <p>\n        It is calculated by applying the{' '}\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity\">\n          cosine similarity\n        </a>{' '}\n        to the constructed vectors for each of the four criteria. When comparing\n        two fragments, their similarity is calculated using the vectors of the\n        criteria for which the user assigned a non-zero weight. The criteria\n        vectors are constructed using the information associated with all the\n        interpretations of the fragment multiplied by the weight assigned by the\n        user to that criterion, a value between 0.2 and 1.0.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q30Q\">How is the vector associated with the heteronym?</h5>\n\n      <p>\n        The heteronym vector has two cells, one for each of the heteronyms,\n        Vicente Guedes and Bernardo Soares. A cell has a value of 1.0 if at\n        least one of the interpretations assigns the heteronomy of the fragment\n        to the heteronym associated with that cell and 0.0 otherwise. For\n        example, if a fragment is attributed to Vicente Guedes by one of the\n        editors and to Bernardo Soares by two of the other editors, the\n        heteronym vector will have 1.0 in both cells.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q31Q\">How is the vector associated with the date calculated?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The date vector has 22 cells, one for each of the years between the year\n        of the first fragment assigned to the <em>Book,</em> 1913, and the year\n        of the last assigned fragment, 1934. If, for example, two\n        interpretations assign different dates to one fragment, their respective\n        cells will have a value of 1.0 and the rest will be filled with values\n        of less than 1.0 with a decay of MAX (0.0, 1.0 - N x 0.1) in which N is\n        the distance between the year associated with the cell and the nearest\n        cell with value 1.0.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q32Q\">How is the vector associated with the text calculated?</h5>\n      <p>\n        Initially, the set of the first 100{' '}\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\">tf-idf</a> (\n        <em>term frequency-inverse document frequency</em>) of the terms of each\n        of the two fragments being compared are calculated. Note that this set\n        has N terms that can be less than 200, 100 terms for each of the\n        fragments, in case there are equal terms in both fragments. Then a\n        vector is created, with a number of cells equal to N, the cardinality of\n        the set, in which the cell associated with a term has the value 1.0 if\n        it appears in the set of the first N terms <em>td-idf</em> of that\n        fragment, and 0.0 otherwise. Since words on a fragment vary according to\n        transcription, the transcription associated with a representative\n        authorial interpretation is used.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q33Q\">How is the vector associated with taxonomy calculated?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The vector has a number of cells equal to the number of tags in the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive Edition</em> taxonomy. The cell associated with a\n        category has a value of 1.0 if the interpretation of the fragment in the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive Edition</em> has assigned that category to any tag, and\n        has a value of 0.0 otherwise.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q34Q\">\n        What does the reading recommendation mean when all weights in the\n        criteria are set to zero?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        It means there is no similarity between the fragments, i.e., the value\n        of similarity between any two fragments is 0.0.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q35Q\">\n        The similarity is calculated between fragments, but what the\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em> recommends for reading is an interpretation and\n        not a fragment, why?\n      </h5>\n\n      <p>\n        Similarity is calculated between the fragments, but the reading must be\n        done using the transcription of one of the interpretations. Thus, the\n        transcription associated with the edition whose transcription the user\n        is currently reading is suggested for reading.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q36Q\">\n        Can fragments that have been recommended be recommended again?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        Only those fragments that have not been read since the user started a\n        reading sequence are recommended, but if there are only 50 fragments\n        remaining, the <em>Archive</em> will again consider the first 50\n        fragments read for its recommendation.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q37Q\">Can more than one fragment be recommended?</h5>\n      <p>\n        Yes, the system suggests the most similar fragment to the one that is\n        being read plus all fragments whose difference between their similarity\n        value and the suggested similarity value is less than 0.001, up to a\n        maximum of 5 fragments. Note that the suggested fragment is the most\n        similar that has an interpretation in the edition of the transcription\n        that is currently being read.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q38Q\">\n        Why is it that after a fragment interpretation is recommended, no\n        further interpretation of the same fragment is recommenced, even if the\n        interpretation read is from an edition that has two interpretations for\n        that fragment?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        This is because the mechanism of recommendation of interpretations for\n        reading is based on the calculation of the similarity between fragments.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 id=\"T8T\">Virtual Edition</h3>\n      <h5 id=\"Q39Q\">What is a virtual edition?</h5>\n\n      <p>\n        A virtual edition is a selection of fragments that one or more users\n        define by choosing from among existing interpretations. A virtual\n        edition is a unique entity because it allows its virtual editors to\n        choose the fragments they want to include, their ordering, and their\n        annotation through notes and categories. The set of categories\n        associated with a virtual edition defines its taxonomy.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q40Q\">\n        What are the limitations to the editorial function in the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em>?\n      </h5>\n\n      <p>\n        The editorial function in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> is limited to the\n        selection, ordering and annotation of the interpretations of the\n        fragments. Virtual editors cannot change the transcriptions or the\n        modularity of the selected interpretations. These limitations are\n        determined by two factors: on the one hand, by the need to control the\n        quality of the transcriptions and the encoding associated with them; on\n        the other hand, by the need to limit the complexity of processing the\n        materials produced by users. The inclusion of a transcription and\n        encoding module, with its own validation system — which would be\n        particularly useful in the context of specialized learning of digital\n        critical editing — may be considered in the future, depending on the\n        available resources.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q41Q\">\n        What is <em>LdoD Archive Edition</em>?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        It is an experimental edition of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> that uses the\n        representative authorial interpretation of each of the fragments. It\n        also includes a taxonomy for the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> defined by\n        the editors of the <em>Archive</em>, who additionally have annotated the\n        interpretations using the categories of that taxonomy.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q42Q\">How can I create a virtual edition?</h5>\n      <p>\n        In the virtual interface you can create a new virtual edition. The\n        virtual edition can use an already existing expert or virtual edition as\n        its base, thus inheriting all the information associated with the base\n        edition. If an edition is not chosen as the base, the new virtual\n        edition starts without having any associated interpretation. In case of\n        using a virtual edition as a base, the new virtual edition contains all\n        notes about the fragments that were made at the level of the base\n        edition. However, it is not possible to change these annotations at the\n        level of the new virtual edition, but if they are changed at the level\n        of its base edition, by editors of the base edition, the effects of the\n        changes are visible in the new virtual edition. This criterion was\n        chosen to respect the authorship of the annotations.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q43Q\">\n        Can a virtual edition have more than one interpretation of the same\n        fragment?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        No, it is only possible to associate one interpretation per fragment\n        with a virtual edition.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q44Q\">How do I add an interpretation to a virtual edition?</h5>\n      <p>\n        There are several ways to associate an interpretation of a fragment with\n        a virtual edition: (a) when the interpretation is being viewed on the\n        edition comparison screen, it is possible to add it individually if it\n        is not already part of the virtual edition; (b) in the manual sorting\n        interface of the virtual edition you can also search for fragments and\n        add them to the virtual edition.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q45Q\">\n        How can I remove an interpretation from a virtual edition?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        In the manual sorting interface of the virtual edition you can select\n        one or more interpretations and remove them.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q46Q\">\n        Who can add to and remove interpretations from a virtual edition?\n      </h5>\n      <p>All editors of the virtual edition.</p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q47Q\">\n        Can I collaborate with other people in building a virtual edition?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        Yes, a virtual edition can have multiple editors. There are two types of\n        role for participants in a virtual edition: managers and editors.\n        Managers can add new members to the virtual edition, they just need to\n        know which is their User Name. On the other hand, managers can accept\n        requests from new editors for joining a virtual edition. Any user can\n        apply to join a public virtual edition. A manager can remove another\n        user from the list of editors or change his/her role. Note that managers\n        are also, inherently, editors, thus having all the privileges of an\n        editor.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q48Q\">\n        What distinguishes a public virtual edition from a private one?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        A private edition is only visible and can only be manipulated by its\n        editors. A public edition is visible to the entire <em>LdoD Archive</em>{' '}\n        community, but can only be altered by its editors, with the exception of\n        annotations in those cases where creation of annotations is allowed to\n        authenticated users. Only managers of a virtual edition can change the\n        state of the edition from private to public, as well as its name and\n        acronym.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q49Q\">\n        How can I annotate the interpretations of a virtual edition?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        Interpretations of a virtual edition can be annotated manually and\n        automatically. Manual annotation can be applied to the entire\n        transcription or to a portion of the transcription text. Manual\n        annotation occurs in the edition comparison interface. Manual annotation\n        of a portion of text is done by selecting the text, and then a comment\n        can be associated with the annotation as well as a set of categories of\n        the taxonomy of the virtual edition. Manual annotation of the whole\n        transcription can be viewed in the same interface as the annotation of a\n        portion, but in the former case the categories are associated with the\n        whole transcription. Of course, in the same annotation interface it is\n        also possible to remove comments and their categories. The automatic\n        annotation of the interpretations of a virtual edition occurs when the\n        topic-generating algorithm is applied, within the interface of the\n        virtual edition, resulting in the annotation the transcription of those\n        interpretations with the generated categories.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q50Q\">Who can annotate interpretations of a virtual edition?</h5>\n      <p>\n        In the taxonomy interface, within the virtual edition, managers of the\n        virtual edition can indicate who can annotate an interpretation. Two\n        possibilities are offered: the creation of annotations is restricted to\n        editors of the virtual edition; or any authenticated user can create\n        annotations. With regard to editing and removing annotations, only the\n        user who created them can perform these operations.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q51Q\">How do you define the set of categories of a taxonomy?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The taxonomy of a virtual edition can be open or closed, depending on\n        whether you can or cannot add new categories when annotating an\n        interpretation. The annotation of an interpretation occurs in the\n        interface for edition comparison. In cases where the taxonomy is open,\n        the set of categories increases whenever a category not existing in the\n        taxonomy is included in an annotation. On the other hand, for both open\n        and closed taxonomies, it is possible to change the existing set of\n        categories through category creation operations, such as joining two or\n        more categories, separating one category into two, and category removal.\n        This manipulation of the set of taxonomy categories is done through the\n        virtual edition taxonomy interface. It is also possible to automatically\n        increase the number of categories of a virtual edition by applying the\n        topic-generation algorithm.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q52Q\">Who can define whether a taxonomy is open or closed?</h5>\n      <p>\n        In the taxonomy interface, within a virtual edition, virtual edition\n        managers can define whether the taxonomy is open or closed.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q53Q\">What is the topic-generation algorithm?</h5>\n      <p>\n        The{' '}\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model\">\n          topic-generation algorithm\n        </a>{' '}\n        groups the interpretations of the virtual edition into topics. Each of\n        these topics is included in the taxonomy as a new category. In the\n        generation process, the user can indicate how many different topics\n        he/she wants to see generated, the number of words he/she will have in\n        the name of the new category (the most relevant words in the topic are\n        chosen), the similarity value in order for an interpretation to be\n        included in the topic (so that the interpretation can be automatically\n        annotated by its category), and the number of iterations that the\n        algorithm must execute before generating the topics (iterations must be\n        between 1500 and 2000 in order for the results to be reliable). Through\n        the application of the algorithm, an interpretation can be associated\n        with several categories. For automatic generation of topics, one must\n        access the taxonomy in the interface of the virtual edition.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q54Q\">Who can change the categories of a virtual edition?</h5>\n      <p>\n        In the taxonomy interface, within a virtual edition, managers can define\n        whether it is only managers who can manipulate the categories, or\n        whether all editors of the virtual edition can do so.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q55Q\">\n        Can I use the base edition taxonomy categories in my virtual edition\n        annotations?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        Yes, when using a virtual edition in the creation of a new virtual\n        edition you can use the categories of the base taxonomy to annotate the\n        interpretations in the new virtual edition. These categories are\n        prefixed with the acronym, in uppercase, of the virtual edition used.\n        Note that if a category used is deleted or its name is changed in the\n        base virtual edition, these changes are reflected in the annotation that\n        used that category in the new virtual edition because the{' '}\n        <em>LdoD Archive</em> preserves the authorship of the annotations.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q56Q\">\n        How can I reorder the interpretations in a virtual edition?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        There are two modes for reordering the interpretations: a manual mode\n        and an assisted mode. The manual mode occurs in the editing interface of\n        the virtual edition and consists of the selection of the interpretations\n        whose position we intend to change followed by their placement in a new\n        position. It is also possible to change the ordering of the\n        interpretations in a virtual edition using the recommendation algorithm\n        of the virtual edition. This is called the assisted mode. The\n        recommendation algorithm is identical to that used in the reading\n        recommendation, with the difference that the taxonomy similarity\n        naturally uses the taxonomy of the virtual edition, rather than the\n        taxonomy of the <em>LdoD Archive Edition</em>. Once the recommendation\n        algorithm is applied, all interpretations are ordered starting from the\n        first, i.e. the second interpretation is the most similar to the first,\n        and the third is the most similar to the second, excluding the first\n        interpretation, and so on. To generate a new order, you can change the\n        criteria or place another interpretation as the initial one. Once the\n        ordering has been changed by the recommendation algorithm, it can be\n        saved, leading to a redefinition of the numbering associated with each\n        interpretation.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q57Q\">\n        Who can reorder the interpretations in a virtual edition?\n      </h5>\n      <p>All the editors of that virtual edition.</p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q58Q\">\n        When a virtual edition is created which are its default settings?\n      </h5>\n      <p>\n        By default the virtual editors can annotate the interpretations, but\n        this possibility is not allowed to authenticated users; only managers\n        can change the categories of the taxonomy; and the vocabulary of the\n        taxonomy is open.\n      </p>\n      <h5 id=\"Q59Q\">\n        What might be some of the typical scenarios associated with creating\n        virtual editions?\n      </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          (a) A teacher decides to create a virtual edition so that his/her\n          students can annotate the fragments according to a predefined\n          taxonomy. In this scenario the virtual edition is private, only the\n          teacher and the students will have access, the teacher being the\n          virtual edition manager and the students its editors. Only the teacher\n          can manipulate the categories of the taxonomy, and the students can\n          annotate the interpretations. The vocabulary of taxonomy is closed.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          (b) A researcher wishes to conduct a study on the social\n          interpretation of the <em>Book of Disquiet </em>which involves the\n          participation of a non-predefined number of persons. In order to do\n          this s/he creates a public virtual edition of which s/he is the only\n          editor and manager, defines the taxonomy vocabulary as open and gives\n          annotation access to all authenticated users. Once the virtual edition\n          is set up, s/he disseminates the experiment through social media\n          requesting that interested participants register in the{' '}\n          <em>LdoD Archive</em> and begin to annotate the interpretations,\n          either by creating new categories or using the already existing\n          categories.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          (c) A group of Humanities students wishes to supplement the{' '}\n          <em>LdoD Archive Edition</em> with an additional set of categories and\n          annotations. In order to do this they create a new virtual edition\n          that uses <em>LdoD Archive Edition </em>as its base, restrict\n          annotation to its editors, and allow all of them to change taxonomy\n          categories. In this scenario the taxonomy vocabulary should be open.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          (d) A lover of the work of Pessoa wishes to make his/her own edition\n          of the <em>Book</em>. For this s/he creates a private virtual edition\n          without using any of the existing ones. S/he adds the interpretations\n          s/he considers to be relevant, defining their specific order.\n          Additionally s/he defines this edition’s taxonomy and annotates the\n          interpretations. When s/he finishes the edition, s/he makes it public\n          and announces its publication. In this scenario, there is only one\n          editor, who is also the manager. This editor-manager can create\n          categories for a taxonomy with an open vocabulary to annotate the\n          interpretations, but other users cannot annotate interpretations.\n
