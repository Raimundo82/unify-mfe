How can we design the digital medium in a way\n        that goes beyond the printed codex? This book is an attempt to answer\n        those fundamental questions by bringing together a new theory of\n        literary studies with a highly dynamic digital environment.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Using the digital archive of the modernist masterpiece{' '}\n        <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, by the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa\n        (1888-1935), as case study and site for simulation and practical\n        experiment, <em>Literary Simulation and the Digital Humanities</em>{' '}\n        demonstrates how computational approaches to texts can fully engage with\n        the complexities of contemporary literary theory. Manuel Portela\n        marshals a unique combination of theoretical speculation, literary\n        analysis, and human imagination in what amounts to a significant\n        critical intervention and a key advance in the use of digital methods to\n        rethink the processes of reading and writing literature.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The foregrounding of the foundational practices of reading, editing, and\n        writing will be relevant for several fields, including literary studies,\n        scholarly editing, software studies, and digital humanities.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n      <h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n      <p>\n        Incipit: Evolutionary Textual Environment\n        <br />\n        1.
