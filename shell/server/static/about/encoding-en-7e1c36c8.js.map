The XML TEI guidelines</h3>\n      <p>\n        All transcriptions in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> have been encoded\n        according to the{' '}\n        <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/\" target=\"new\">\n          <em>TEI Guidelines</em>\n        </a>{' '}\n        (Text Encoding and Interchange). These guidelines for text encoding have\n        been developed since 1988 by a consortium of institutions — the{' '}\n        <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml\" target=\"new\">\n          Text Encoding Initiative Consortium\n        </a>\n        . The TEI guidelines define a large set of elements and attributes in\n        XML (\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\" target=\"new\">\n          Extensible Markup Language\n        </a>\n        ) for representing structural, conceptual, and rendering features of\n        texts. Considering that the XML format is both a human and\n        machine-readable text encoding language, TEI can be described as a\n        textual analysis method for digital processing. It takes advantage of\n        the interoperability of the XML format, in order to describe in detail\n        textual facts and events through a specific syntax and semantics. It is\n        a very powerful convention, composed of encoding modules for all kinds\n        of problems of representation of structures and textual forms, which\n        extend from the invention of writing to current electronic documents.\n        The current version of the{' '}\n        <em>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</em> (TEI\n        P5) was published in November 2007 and continues to be updated\n        periodically. At the time of writing, the latest update was made in July\n        2017 (version 3.2.0).\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>\n        2. XML TEI applied to the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        In the case of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>, our TEI encoding schema\n        involved the parallel segmentation method and the definition of a\n        critical apparatus which treats all transcriptions as textual\n        variations. Thus, one can automatically compare not only variations that\n        occur in the witnesses, but also variations between witness\n        transcriptions across the editions. Although witnesses are marked up as\n        such, all variations (whether they occur in the autographs or in the\n        editions) are processed at the same level. This encoding decision\n        expresses the theoretical principle that underlies the\n        <em> LdoD Archive: </em>that of showing the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> as\n        both authorial project and editorial project, making it possible to\n        observe the transformation of the archive into editions as a dynamic\n        process of generation of textual variations.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Our XML TEI encoding template embodies that which in our virtualization\n        model for the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> we describe as the genetic\n        dimension, that is, the process of authoring (writing and rewriting),\n        and also that which we have called the social dimension, that is, the\n        historical process of reinscription and socialization of texts (editing\n        and reediting) under specific editorial and bibliographic forms (Portela\n        &amp; Silva, 2014). In turn, the virtual dimension (which is the\n        designation of textual socialization of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> in\n        the specific context of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>) consists of the\n        possibility of constructing virtual editions through the combination of\n        textual units as defined by the authorial interpretations and/or\n        editorial interpretations (thus inheriting the XML TEI structure of\n        those units). The dynamism of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> depends on the\n        modularization produced by its data model, but also on the versatility\n        in comparing transcriptions enabled by its text encoding template.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This way, XML TEI encoding is used simultaneously in its\n        representational affordance — that is, in terms of a granular\n        description of specific events on the inscription surface — and in its\n        relational affordance — that is, in terms of the instantaneous reading\n        of micro and macrovariations at different textual scales within the\n        corpus. It is as if all transcriptions of all witnesses and editions\n        were part of a single tree, making words, punctuation marks, blank\n        spaces, paragraph divisions, and text divisions comparable to each\n        other. The exhaustiveness and complexity of the encoding of the\n        variations allows us to move recursively across three scales: the scale\n        of character, punctuation mark, and blank space as minimum units of\n        inscription; the scale of word, sentence, paragraph and textual block as\n        semantic units; and the scale of ordered sequence of texts and book as\n        discursive and material instantiations of a certain idea of the work.\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>3. Encoding criteria</h3>\n      <p>\n        {' '}\n        The <em>LdoD Archive </em>team has adopted a set of criteria for\n        encoding the various acts of authorial and editorial inscription. These\n        criteria were sometimes determined by the need to simplify the\n        processing and visualization of marked-up text. This section explains\n        the main options taken to ensure the balance between the textual and\n        semantic accuracy of the markup, on the one hand, and the readability of\n        the visualization of the genetic layer and of the comparisons across the\n        transcriptions, on the other. Although there is a mimetic topographic\n        component in the markup of the witnesses, it is subordinated to the\n        abstract data model whose main function is to guarantee the\n        comparability both across the transcriptions and across the relative\n        order of the documents in each edition. Our main goal is not to emulate\n        the documents but to model them for processing purposes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Encoding spaces and division markers</strong>\n        <br />\n        Spaces between paragraphs, between title and text, and between blocks of\n        text have been marked up<em> in their relative proportions</em>, both in\n        relation to the witnesses and in relation to the editions. Instead of\n        first-line indentation for paragraphs, we opted for one-line spacing\n        between paragraphs, in order to improve the readability of the\n        transcriptions for screen reading. All other spaces correspond to spaces\n        that appear in the witnesses and editions. All division markers also\n        correspond to dashes and horizontal rulers that appear in the witnesses\n        and editions. Spaces and division markers are important elements in the\n        articulation of the internal and external divisions of each text.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Encoding deletions</strong>\n        <br />\n        Deleted text (&lt;del&gt;) has been marked up with the values\n        “overstrike” and “overtyped”. Both are displayed by a strike over the\n        erased word.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Encoding additions</strong>\n        <br />\n        Additions (&lt;add&gt;) have been marked up with the values “below”,\n        “above”, “inline”, “top”, “bottom” and “margin,” which define the place\n        (&lt;place&gt;) of the added text in relation to the text segment to\n        which it applies or the place where it appears on the page. The “margin”\n        value was usually reserved for added text in the margins, but{' '}\n        <em>not for text that simply continues on the margins</em>, as often\n        happens. In these cases, the change of place of the text on the page is\n        marked up only by a line break or a line break and a space.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Encoding substitutions </strong>\n        <br />\n        Encoding substitutions (&lt;subst&gt;) involves marking up a deleted\n        element (&lt;del&gt;) and an added element (&lt;add&gt;). The simple\n        visualization of the witness transcription can sometimes suggest that a\n        given element is an addition, since it is preceded by the sign ∧,\n        generally used as a sign for inserted elements. In such cases, the\n        ambiguity can be clarified by selecting the “show deleted”, “highlight\n        inserted” and “highlight substitutions” boxes at the same time. In the\n        second paragraph of{' '}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://ldod.uc.pt/fragments/fragment/Fr044/inter/Fr044_WIT_MS_Fr044a_51\"\n          target=\"new\">\n          BNP/E3 1-50r\n        </a>\n        , for example, the interface shows an addition (dean- teira ∧d’ella)\n        when the witness has only the deletion of the plural ending (dean- teira\n        d’ellas). In this case, the option of marking up the substitution\n        implied explicitly replacing “d’ellas” by “d’ella” (as if there was, in\n        fact, an addition), since that is the semantic implication of the\n        deletion. This marking up rule{' '}\n        <em>\n          has been applied to all occurrences where partial deletion of a word\n          transforms it into another word — for example, a plural into a\n          singular or a masculine into a feminine.{' '}\n        </em>\n        Although there is no addition, the change is graphically and\n        semantically marked up as if there was. The disambiguation of these\n        encoding options implies that the boxes “show deleted”, “highlight\n        inserted” and “highlight substitutions” are checked, as well as the\n        collation with the digital facsimile. This option was taken because of\n        textual rendering, since the marking up of isolated letters would result\n        in the presentation of a space before and after the letter, decreasing\n        readability. The “show deleted” and “highlight inserted” options were\n        not synchronized (which would have helped clarify that ambiguity) since\n        their separate use allows users to observe revision sites more clearly.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Encoding variants</strong>\n        <br />\n        The marking up of variants is rendered through the simultaneous presence\n        of the alternatives in a different color from the rest of the text.\n        Besides, when you mouse over each variant, the associated probability\n        value appears. This value results from the division of the unit by the\n        number of textual variants. In the first paragraph of{' '}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://ldod.uc.pt/fragments/fragment/Fr044/inter/Fr044_WIT_MS_Fr044a_51\"\n          target=\"new\">\n          BNP/E3 1-50r\n        </a>\n        , for example, the interface shows the variants “rancor” and “torpor”\n        with a probability of being excluded of 0.5 each (“excl 0.5”). When\n        there are three variants, the distribution is usually a combination of\n        0.3, 0.3 and 0.4. However, there are cases in which the need to combine\n        topographical markup with variant markup{' '}\n        <em>\n          implied the use of more values than the number of actual textual\n          variants\n        </em>\n        , since line breaks cannot be marked up inside the probability values\n        and it is necessary to retag the variant as a variant after each line\n        break. In these cases, the value of the probability is arbitrary and\n        must be adjusted to reflect the real number of variants, and not the\n        number of line breaks, as it happens. It is a situation that arises from\n        the impossibility of nesting those two hierarchies in the XML TEI\n        syntax.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Encoding variations</strong>\n        <br />\n        The adopted encoding also enables the observation of all variations\n        across the interpretations, that is, it allows us to compare our new\n        transcription of the witnesses against the transcription in Prado\n        Coelho-1982 against the transcription in Sobral Cunha-2008 against the\n        transcription in Zenith-2012 against the transcription in Pizarro-2010\n        for each fragment of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>. The critical\n        apparatus (&lt;app&gt;) of these variations was classified according to\n        five typologies (&lt;type&gt;): “orthographic”, which identifies\n        orthographic variations; “punctuation”, for punctuation variations;\n        “paragraph”, which marks up variations in paragraph division; “style”\n        for identifying typographic style variations (for example, use of\n        italics or capitals); and “substantive” to indicate differences in the\n        transcribed word (for example, when experts select divergent variants or\n        read a particular passage differently). Marked-up variations (which\n        refer to the existing differences{' '}\n        <em>in the set of all the interpretations of a given fragment</em>) are\n        visualized either through colour highlighting or through the table of\n        variations for each comparison.\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>4.
