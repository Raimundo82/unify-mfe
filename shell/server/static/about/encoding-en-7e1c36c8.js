These guidelines for text encoding have been developed since 1988 by a consortium of institutions — the"," ",e("a",{href:"http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml",target:"new"},"Text Encoding Initiative Consortium"),". The TEI guidelines define a large set of elements and attributes in XML (",e("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML",target:"new"},"Extensible Markup Language"),") for representing structural, conceptual, and rendering features of texts. Considering that the XML format is both a human and machine-readable text encoding language, TEI can be described as a textual analysis method for digital processing. It takes advantage of the interoperability of the XML format, in order to describe in detail textual facts and events through a specific syntax and semantics. It is a very powerful convention, composed of encoding modules for all kinds of problems of representation of structures and textual forms, which extend from the invention of writing to current electronic documents. The current version of the"," ",e("em",null,"Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange")," (TEI P5) was published in November 2007 and continues to be updated periodically.

Thus, one can automatically compare not only variations that occur in the witnesses, but also variations between witness transcriptions across the editions. Although witnesses are marked up as such, all variations (whether they occur in the autographs or in the editions) are processed at the same level. This encoding decision expresses the theoretical principle that underlies the",e("em",null," LdoD Archive: "),"that of showing the ",e("em",null,"Book of Disquiet")," as both authorial project and editorial project, making it possible to observe the transformation of the archive into editions as a dynamic process of generation of textual variations."),e("p",null,"Our XML TEI encoding template embodies that which in our virtualization model for the ",e("em",null,"Book of Disquiet")," we describe as the genetic dimension, that is, the process of authoring (writing and rewriting), and also that which we have called the social dimension, that is, the historical process of reinscription and socialization of texts (editing and reediting) under specific editorial and bibliographic forms (Portela & Silva, 2014). In turn, the virtual dimension (which is the designation of textual socialization of the ",e("em",null,"Book of Disquiet")," in the specific context of the ",e("em",null,"LdoD Archive"),") consists of the possibility of constructing virtual editions through the combination of textual units as defined by the authorial interpretations and/or editorial interpretations (thus inheriting the XML TEI structure of those units).

It is as if all transcriptions of all witnesses and editions were part of a single tree, making words, punctuation marks, blank spaces, paragraph divisions, and text divisions comparable to each other. The exhaustiveness and complexity of the encoding of the variations allows us to move recursively across three scales: the scale of character, punctuation mark, and blank space as minimum units of inscription; the scale of word, sentence, paragraph and textual block as semantic units; and the scale of ordered sequence of texts and book as discursive and material instantiations of a certain idea of the work."),e("p",null," "),e("h3",null,"3. Encoding criteria"),e("p",null," ","The ",e("em",null,"LdoD Archive "),"team has adopted a set of criteria for encoding the various acts of authorial and editorial inscription.

This section explains the main options taken to ensure the balance between the textual and semantic accuracy of the markup, on the one hand, and the readability of the visualization of the genetic layer and of the comparisons across the transcriptions, on the other. Although there is a mimetic topographic component in the markup of the witnesses, it is subordinated to the abstract data model whose main function is to guarantee the comparability both across the transcriptions and across the relative order of the documents in each edition.
